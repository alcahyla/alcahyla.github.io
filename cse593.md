## CSE 593 - Introduction to VLSI Electronics with Professor Sridhar

As someone with a keen interest in using microcontrollers and embedded processors to solve problems, I was 
eager to learn more about the architecture of digital circuits. Although CSE 593 did not cover the design of 
a computer processor, it did cover the design of fundamental digital components and the layout of a custom 
chip.
 
We began the course with CMOS logic and learned how logic gates, registers, latches, and multiplexers are 
built on the transistor level. As the course progressed, we covered more complicated components, such as 
adders, multipliers, and DRAM. One focus of the course was on design for low power and high performance. We 
discussed ways to save power, such as clock gating.
 
Lab exercises were a significant component of CSE 593. Using Cadence, I learned how to design the schematic 
for a digital circuit, then lay out the physical transistors for production on a silicon wafer. Learning to 
use the tools in Cadence to develop the layout was the most challenging part of the course for me, but by 
the end I came to really enjoy routing layers of metal and polysilicon around my chip. I learned how to 
ensure my circuit passed the design rule checks, which are checks that make sure that the layout meets 
certain physical specifications of the process, and layout vs. schematic checks, which check that the logic 
of the layout is the same as the layout of the schematic. Once complete, the circuits were simulated with 
transient inputs to check that the outputs were computed as expected. 

For our final project, we worked in small groups to design a small computer chip with 16 IO pins. My group 
chose to design a traffic light controller, which was modeled as a finite state machine. An open-ended 
project was more challenging than the class assignments. First, we discussed how our traffic light 
controller would operate and which cases it would handle. We decided it would work on a timer, but the 
timing would be affected based on whether cars were waiting at certain areas of the intersection. Due to 
this, our circuit required four inputs. We then mapped out the logic of the finite state machine and 
translated the logic into digital components. Next, we created schematics for each of the components in 
Cadence. After that, we created the layout for every component. Finally, we assembled all of our components 
onto a chip in Cadence and simulated the chip’s response to various inputs. I completed a large part of the 
component layouts. The final assembly on the chip was especially difficult - the component that we were 
given was confusing to work with. Our group needed to discuss with the TA to make sure that everything was 
working as expected. At the linked page are screenshots of the process. [Link here to page with screenshots

In the end, the final project required a good deal of team collaboration. It was difficult to coordinate 
everyone’s schedules and to make sure that everyone’s individual parts worked together. We set up regular 
team meetings and were flexible on the tasks assigned to each person. We presented our final project as a 
team, but we were able to emphasize our own individual contributions.

This was certainly a difficult course due to the need to learn how to use Cadence, a complicated piece of 
software, without much guidance. However, I do think it was an extremely valuable course. Despite being 
offered by the computer science department, I think it is a must for any electrical engineering student. 
Although my immediate career goals don’t include the design of VLSI circuits, this was one of the most 
interesting classes I have taken. I feel that a deep understanding of digital logic and the principles 
involved in manufacturing digital chips have given me a better understanding of how microprocessors operate. 
Programming microprocessors also has the goal of low power use and high performance and understanding how 
the hardware works is essential to writing efficient software.
