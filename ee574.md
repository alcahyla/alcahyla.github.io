## EE 574 - RF/Microwave Circuits II with Professor Singisetti

This class was the second in a series. It followed RF/Microwave Circuits I, which introduced transmission 
lines, reflection coefficients, impedance matching, and reading Smith charts. In lab, we used a vector 
network analyzer to analyze the scattering parameters of circuits that we assembled. I chose to continue the 
series with the second course. This was partially because I wanted to learn more about advanced circuit 
design and partially because I heard that the second course was very difficult and I wanted to prove to 
myself that I could handle the challenge. RF II emphasized active RF devices like diodes, MOSFETS, and BJTs, 
and delved into their use in detectors, mixers, power amplifiers, and oscillators.
 
This was a lab-heavy course, where the theory discussed in class needed to be applied to our own circuit 
designs. I worked with a partner to complete a design of an RF circuit, such as an amplifier, before each 
lab session. We created our schematics in Advanced Design System, a CAD tool, and brought simulations of our 
circuit to our lab session to prove that our design would meet the requirements. Then, in the lab, we 
selected components and assembled our design. This lab was my first exposure to surface-mount soldering, and 
at first it was very difficult to get a handle on the correct soldering technique. The components seemed 
microscopic and my hands felt like they shook uncontrollably. Luckily, the lab period was long enough to 
accommodate a lot of trial and error, and eventually it became easier. This experience was valuable because 
I needed to solder frequently during my summer internship, and I was able to do so confidently. After our 
components were assembled, we used the vector network analyzer to see how our circuit operated and to 
confirm that it met the design specifications. An example of a design that we fabricated in the lab is 
linked here: [Link to power amplifier schematic, photo of circuit, and simulated vs. actual Smith charts]. 
Our designs never seemed to operate as predicted by our simulations, and discussion with other lab groups 
revealed that they often encountered the same problem. The errors might have been due to my poor soldering 
skills or maybe even accidentally swapping similar-looking components.

Unfortunately, there was never enough time in the lab sessions to really get to the bottom of what was going wrong in the circuit. If a little 
extra solder to a loose-looking capacitor didn’t fix the problem, we had to move on. I think having more 
time scheduled to allow for modifying the design or re-soldering components would have been useful and given 
me an opportunity to improve my hardware debugging skills. Even one larger lab-based final project would 
have accomplished this. Even so, I do think that the lab period helped me learn the steps involved in 
bringing a design to life.
 
To me, the part of the course that covered mixers and their use in radio transmitters and receivers was the 
most interesting because it is something that is found in every radio. Unfortunately, this was not 
incorporated into any lab project, but I hope that I’ll be able to incorporate it into a personal project at 
some point. 

This course was one of my favorites because it covered many useful applications of Rf circuits. I also think 
that its approach to teaching us how to design circuits was very useful. Even if I do not work with 
Rf/microwave frequencies, I think that a detailed knowledge of oscillator and amplifier design is important 
for any hardware designer.
