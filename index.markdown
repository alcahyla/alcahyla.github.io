title: About Me
---

My name is Alicia Hyland, and I will graduate from the University of Buffalo with an Electrical Engineering M.S. in December 2023. I am interested in embedded software and using 
microcontrollers to solve problems. After completing a bachelor's degree in math and working for several years as 
a software developer, I realized that I wanted a deeper understanding of physical hardware. I returned to school 
at U.B. to complete my master's degree, and during my time here, I have had the opportunity to complete a variety 
of relevant courses. Linked above are some reflections on the knowledge that I gained through these courses and 
how they apply to my career goals.

This past summer, I worked as an intern for X-Ray Optical Systems. I participated in writing clean and testable 
firmware in C. I also designed and built a functional test fixture to ensure the correct operation of custom 
microcontroller boards. I look forward to continuing to develop my skills in electrical and embedded design.
